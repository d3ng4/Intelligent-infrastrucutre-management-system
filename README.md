Features
View the list of infrastructure components along with their current status and last inspection date.
Inspect and update the status of infrastructure components with the date of the latest inspection.


Requirements

Python 3
Flask (install using pip install Flask)
Backend API Endpoints

GET /api/infrastructure: Fetch the list of infrastructure components with their details.

POST /api/inspect_infrastructure: Inspect and update the status of an infrastructure component.


Frontend Usage
The homepage will display the list of infrastructure components, including their names, current status, and the last inspection date.
To inspect an infrastructure component, go to the "Inspect Infrastructure" section, select an infrastructure component from the dropdown, update its status, and set the date of the latest inspection. Click on "Submit Inspection" to record the inspection.


Note
This is a basic example for demonstration purposes and lacks real-time data integration or advanced error handling.
In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement authentication, proper validation, and integrate with a database for persistent storage.
Feel free to customize and extend the system to meet your specific requirements!
